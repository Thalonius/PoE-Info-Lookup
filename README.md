PoE Info Lookup can read txt-files in it's folder and display the data.

Each Header (like: [Example]) is shown on the left side.
All the text lines between two headers are shown on the right for the selected header.
So add new files as you please!

The first dropdown lets you select which file content will be shown.
The search filters the Header and the Data.

So if you have "Archnemesis Mods" selected you could enter "dropped items" to see all Archnemesis Mods that would convert the dropped items in some way.
Or you could enter "Effi" to see what the Effigy mod does.

The tool starts with a hidden GUI. You can either show it via Tray Menu or use the Shortcut Ctrl-i.

###### The tool is provided as is. You can either use the Source Code (.ahk) (AutoHotkey file) or the compiled version (.exe).
